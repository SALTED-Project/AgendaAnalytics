# Agenda Analytics 


## Introduction


#### üìù Description

Agenda Analytics has the matching of given agendas to the activities of companies and public administration as its content. The obtained matching scores can be used for detailed reporting and visualization.
(Agendas of interest could not only be the sustainable development goals (SDGs) or environmental social governance risks in banks (ESGs) but also e. g. the public governance codex, addressing the emerging interest on governance topics in public companies. Additionally any interested party could develop their own agenda, summarizing key aspects to them, under which they intend to analyse companies of interest.)

#### üèÜ Value Proposition

This application leverages public data to generate value for the public, by extracting information needed for an automatic assessment of the given agenda. Therefor the public gains access to knowledge, which wasn't available before. Additionally the application shows the added value that can be generated by crawling available webdocuments.

## Infrastructure

The above use case is realized by the following services.
The documentation for each single service can be found in the corresponding service directories (see: ``./services``):

* [AgendaAnalytics-Commons](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-Commons/README.rst)
* [AgendaAnalytics-DiscoverAndStore](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-DiscoverAndStore/README.rst)
* [AgendaAnalytics-Mapping](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-Mapping/README.rst)
* [AgendaAnalytics-Publish](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-Publish/README.rst)
* [AgendaAnalytics-Crawling](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-Crawling/README.rst)
* [AgendaAnalytics-AgendaMatching](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-AgendaMatching/README.rst)
* [AgendaAnalytics-SimCore](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-SimCore/README.rst)
* [AgendaAnalytics-SearchEngine](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-SearchEngine/README.rst)

    * own google api key needed

* [AgendaAnalytics-FileServer](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-FileServer/README.rst)
* [AgendaAnalytics-VDPP](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-VDPP/README.rst)

    * dockerhub pull acces for kybeidosci repo needed (access tokens will be granted by Kybeidos GmbH: team@agenda-analytics.eu)      

* [AgendaAnalytics-MQTTtrigger](https://github.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/blob/master/services/AgendaAnalytics-MQTTtrigger/README.rst)

Additionally you need:
* Own setup of NGSI-LD Scorpio Broker
* Own setupof MQTT Broker


An exemplary setup / deployment would be:

* e.g. Service Setup: 

    <img align="center" alt="Agenda Analytics services setup" width="80%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/master/info/infrastructure/services_setup.JPG" />

* e.g. Deployment Order:        

    <img align="center" alt="Agenda Analytics services deployment order" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/master/info/infrastructure/services_deploymentorder.JPG" />


This enables the following Data Injection and Enrichment Toolchain:

* e.g. DIT:        

    <img align="center" alt="Agenda Analytics DIT" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/master/info/infrastructure/dit_example.JPG" />

* e.g. DET:        

    <img align="center" alt="Agenda Analytics DET" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SALTED-Project/AgendaAnalytics/master/info/infrastructure/det_example.JPG" />
